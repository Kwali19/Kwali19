HW is divided into Processor & Peripherals /IPs, Digital device works on digital inputs, ADC is analog device used for conversion. 
Peripherals --> Common process which is instanciated multiple times (repeated) are Macros; Analog IPs like GPIOs, ADC, DAC, PLLS
Processor --> Synthesized NL (No Primitives, No Verilog Constraints)
